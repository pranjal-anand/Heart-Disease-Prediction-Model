# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
> Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms for Heart Disease Detection and Prediction.

## Requirements
- Python 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Jupyter-Notebook

## Several Libraries
- numpy: To work with arrays
- pandas: To work with csv files and dataframes
- matplotlib: To create charts using pyplot, define parameters using rcParams and color them with cm.rainbow
- warnings: To ignore all warnings which might be showing up in the notebook due to past/future depreciation of a feature
- train_test_split: To split the dataset into training and testing data
- StandardScaler: To scale all the features, so that the Machine Learning model better adapts to the dataset
- We imported all the necessary Machine Learning algorithms using sklearn

## Instructions for setting up
1. Clone the repo.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pranjal-anand/Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model.git
$ cd "Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model"
```
